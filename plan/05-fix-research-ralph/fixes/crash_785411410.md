# Fix: crash_785411410 - Callee-Save Register Offset Error (Duplicate)

## Summary

This crash is caused by the **same root cause** as documented in `20260205-225448.md` - callee-saved registers stored at positive offsets from FP, outside the allocated stack frame.

## Evidence

Examining `csmith-reports/crash_785411410.s`, the prologue for `func_1`:

```asm
func_1:
	sub	sp, sp, #48
	stp	x29, x30, [sp, #32]
	add	x29, sp, #32
	str	x19, [x29, #16]    ; FP+16 = SP+48 = OUTSIDE FRAME
	str	x20, [x29, #24]    ; FP+24 = SP+56 = OUTSIDE FRAME
	str	x21, [x29, #32]    ; FP+32 = SP+64 = OUTSIDE FRAME
	str	x22, [x29, #40]    ; FP+40 = SP+72 = OUTSIDE FRAME
```

Frame size is 48 bytes (SP to SP+48), but callee-saves go to SP+48 and beyond, corrupting memory.

## Root Cause

See `20260205-225448.md` for full details. In summary:
- `pkg/stacking/layout.go` line 77: `layout.CalleeSaveOffset = 16` (positive)
- `pkg/stacking/calleesave.go` line 130-133: offsets increment from +16

## Fix

Apply the fix described in `20260205-225448.md` - use negative offsets from FP for callee-saved registers.

## Verification

After the fix from `20260205-225448.md` is applied, this crash should be resolved.
