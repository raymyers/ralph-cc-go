# Fix: crash_1176020246 - Callee-Save Register Offset Sign Error (Verified Duplicate)

## Summary

Runtime crash caused by the known callee-saved register offset sign error. This is the same root cause as crash_55976753 and multiple other crashes.

## Evidence

From the generated assembly:

```asm
func_1:
    sub  sp, sp, #48          ; Allocate 48 bytes
    stp  x29, x30, [sp, #32]  ; Save FP/LR at SP+32
    add  x29, sp, #32         ; FP = SP+32
    str  x19, [x29, #16]      ; Store X19 at FP+16 = SP+48 = OUTSIDE FRAME!
    str  x20, [x29, #24]      ; Store X20 at FP+24 = SP+56 = OUTSIDE FRAME!
    str  x21, [x29, #32]      ; Store X21 at FP+32 = SP+64 = OUTSIDE FRAME!
    str  x21, [x29, #40]      ; Store X21 at FP+40 = SP+72 = OUTSIDE FRAME!
```

**Frame Size: 48 bytes (SP to SP+48)**  
**FP points to SP+32**  
**Callee-save stores go beyond SP+48, corrupting caller's frame**

## Root Cause

Same as crash_55976753: `pkg/stacking/layout.go` computes positive offsets for callee-saved registers instead of negative offsets from FP.

## Fix

See `fixes/crash_55976753.md` for the detailed fix plan. This crash will be resolved by the same fix.

## Batch Verification

All 10 unchecked crash reports in PLAN.md were verified to have this same root cause:
- crash_1176020246 - **this file** 
- crash_1870324845 - same issue
- crash_145691413 - same issue
- crash_928313049 - same issue
- crash_1093823871 - same issue
- crash_853828320 - same issue
- crash_1950716464 - same issue
- crash_23463107 - same issue
- crash_3253220824 - same issue
- crash_114128045 - same issue

Each shows callee-saved registers (X19-X28) stored at positive FP offsets that exceed the stack frame boundary.
