# Ralph CC

Can we code a C compiler hands-free?

This is an experiment in a long-horizon task using the OpenHands coding agent with the Ralph Wiggum technique.

See [ARTICLE.md](ARTICLE.md) for a summary of the process and commit history, or checkout our upcoming [Ralph Wiggum webinar](https://luma.com/openhands-webinar-26feb26).

## Ground rules

Manual edits are allowed only on `README.md` and `plan/*`. The other commits must be by agents prompted using a repeatable `plan/*/RALPH.md` and get task-specific instructions from the plans.
